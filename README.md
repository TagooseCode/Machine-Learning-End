# Machine-Learning-End

Hey Guys! So to run this code make sure you do this FIRST:

If you are a WINDOWS user, you might need to reinstall the latest version of Python found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/  
> When you install, MAKE SURE that you CHECK A BOX right at the beginning of the installation: `"Add Python 3.7 to PATH"`. This will allow you to do `pip` installs like everyone else.


Then everyone should type these commands into their terminal:  
> `pip3 install tensorflow`  
`pip3 install opencv-python`  
`pip3 install keras`  
`pip3 install imageai --upgrade`


These might take awhile to download onto your computer.
